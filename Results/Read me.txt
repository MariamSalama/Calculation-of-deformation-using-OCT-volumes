Example volume output : The input data were the volumes provided by the developer 
                        of the tool box
Test volume output (1): Fictitious input data with only one element in the matrix
                        set to 100, and this element has an offset in the second 
                        volume.
Test volume output (2): Fictitious input data with a significantly large number of
                        elements set to 100, and in the second volume it is moved
                        by a large displacement.

 OUTPUTS
---------
   u:  displacement field vector calculated from FIDVC. Format: cell array,
      which is a 3D vector (components in x,y,z)  per each time point
      (units are in voxels)
         u{time}{1} = displacement in x-direction at t=time of size MxNxP
         u{time}{2} = displacement in y-direction at t=time of size MxNxP
         u{time}{3} = displacement in z-direction at t=time of size MxNxP
   cc: peak values of the cross-correlation for each interrogation
